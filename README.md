# Urban-Leaf-Health-Monitoring

Urban-Leaf-Health-Monitoring is an end-to-end system for tracking urban vegetation health and land-use change. Leveraging satellite and aerial imagery, machine learning, and computer vision, it enables robust monitoring of ecological shifts, urban expansion, and deforestation events across diverse regions.

## Key Insights

- **Automated Area Selection:** Efficient sampling and region-of-interest extraction for large-scale analysis.
- **Cloud-Masked Data Pipeline:** Preprocessing ensures high-quality, cloud-free imagery for reliable results.
- **Augmentation & Restoration:** Extensive data augmentation (flipping, zooming, restoration) boosts model robustness.
- **Multispectral Analysis:** Radiometric normalization and spectral transformations (NDVI, EVI, SAVI) provide deep vegetation health insights.
- **Feature Engineering:** Texture (GLCM), spectral statistics, and morphological features enhance classification accuracy.
- **Flexible Modeling:** Supports SVM, Random Forest, and U-Net for both segmentation and health classification.
- **Temporal Event Tracking:** Enables comparison of ecological events (e.g., bushfires, mining) and multi-year change detection.
- **Urban Metrics Visualization:** Generates actionable insights for city planning and conservation.

## Study Regions

- **Hasdeo Forest:** Deforestation and mining impacts (2018–2023)
- **Sydney Blue Mountains Fringe:** Urban expansion and ecological shifts
- **Kangaroo Island:** Black Summer bushfire impacts
